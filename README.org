#+TITLE: My Dotfiles Repo

* Emacs Init File

My Emacs config avoids package management - it uses only ~use-package~ for configuration. All dependencies (extensions, fonts, CLI tools, etc.) are managed via GNU Guix.

* Guix Home

Guix is used as a package manager on a foreign distro.

** Apply Last Changes

Run the following to reconfigure your home environment:

#+begin_src shell
GUIX_PACKAGE_PATH=~/src/dotfiles/guix-home/modules \
  guix home reconfigure ~/src/dotfiles/guix-home/home.scm
#+end_src
